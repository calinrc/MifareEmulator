# MifareEmulator
Mifare Card Emulator

The application purpose is to emulate and existing Mifare Classic 1k card using and android phone with NFC tag support.

It reads a non encrypted Mifare card ( that uses default A and B keys ) and beems the card back when this is needed.


The reader part of the application was taken from MifareClassicTool application writenb by Gerhard Klostermeier (ikarus32)
He has the entire credit for it. Kudos. The source code cand be found here: https://github.com/ikarus23/MifareClassicTool
My work was only to translate from java to kotlin this work.
